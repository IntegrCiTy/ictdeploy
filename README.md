# IntegrCiTy co-simulation deployment API

This package has been made to help in the deployment of a co-simulation using OBNL (url) as orchestrator.
It allows you to create simulation nodes, links, steps and running sequences.
The description for creating wrappers with your tools can be found here (url) as well as examples.
A full working demonstration of this package can be found here (url).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
